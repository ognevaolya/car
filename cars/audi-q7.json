	"information": "The X1's turbo four-cylinder (228 horsepower, 258 pounds-feet of torque) has adequate power for just about all situations, but noticeable — and inconsistent — accelerator lag hampers things from a standstill. Still, once you get past the initial gremlins, power comes early and stays late, and the standard eight-speed automatic transmission finds the right gear without too much delay."
