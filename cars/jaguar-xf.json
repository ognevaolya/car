	"Drives": "A trio of engines are available, and I found the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in my test SE model to be just right. With 231 horsepower, it's the most robust engine in the stable, providing quick, smooth takeoffs and not a hint of turbo lag. The Escape's six-speed automatic aptly delivers power on demand for strain-free highway passing and hill climbs."
